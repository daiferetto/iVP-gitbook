  The 3D panel primarily serves as a visualization area. Similar to the 2D panel, it allows you to position, adjust size, and rotate machinery and objects as if you were working with a traditional paper floor plan.

# 3D-Panel

The 3D-Panel acts as a visualization area where you can work in a three dimensional representation of the room or factory. It is possible to [place](../machines/first-steps-with-3d-object.md), [move](../machines/selecting-and-moving-objects.md), [scale and rotate](../machines/scale-and-rotate-objects.md) machines and objects like in the 2D-panel. However, the 3D-panel also offers functions to take [screenshots](../advanced-tools/creating-screenshots.md) or to work with [virtual cameras](virtual-camera-panel.md) to [record videos](../advanced-tools/virtual-cameras.md).

## The toolbar of the 3D-Panel

The toolbar is located at the top of the panel and contains several buttons that give you quick access to 3D-specific functions and settings.
