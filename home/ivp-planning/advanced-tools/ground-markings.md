# Ground Markings
 
It is possible to convert your path into a ground marking, enabling you to highlight specific areas with color-coding, which will be visible in the [2D-panel](../user-interface/the-2d-panel.md) and [3D-panel](../user-interface/the-3d-panel.md). To do so, simply change the [paths](path-tool.md) type to **Ground Marking** in the [properties panel](../user-interface/the-info-panel.md).

Besides the regular path options, you will also have the option to change the ground markings **line width**, **alignment**, **gap** and its **color** in the [properties panel](..user-interface/..the-info-panel.md)  

* **Line width**: Determines the width of the ground markings outer and inner lines.

* **Alignment**: Adjusts the alignment of the ground markings inner and outer lines to *Center*, *Inside* or *Outside*.

* **Gap**: Adjusts the size of the gap between the inner and outer lines.

* **Color**: Adjusts the color of the ground marking.
