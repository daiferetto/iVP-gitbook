When importing your file, you have the option to change its parameters, as well as the option to add it to your library.

Once you have added an item to your library, the folder "iVP Library" will appear at the bottom of the library window.
From now on every item that you import, and chose to add to your library, can be found inside the "iVP Library" folder.  

The Order of your items can only be changed inside the folder, **not** inside iVP-Planning.
