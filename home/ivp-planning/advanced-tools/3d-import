# 3D-Import

To import any 3D file from your personal computer into iVP-Planning, simply click on the "File" dropdown menu on the upper left side of the client, and select "Import".  
Currently iVP-Planning supports the following file types: jpeg, png, .fbx, .obj, .glb, .gltf, .stl, .ply & .3mf.  

{% hint style="info" %}  
For the best results, we recommend using files with either the **.glb** or **.gltf** extension.   
{% endhint %}

Once you have selected the file you want to upload, you get the option to change your Unit of measurement (mm,, cm, dm, m, ft), and the direction of the Up Axis of the object.

Please note that the Up Axis of the imported object/file must match with the Up Axis you have chosen when exporting the object/file, i.E. Z, X or Y axis.

If you  select the wrong Axis Up option by mistake, you have the option to change it via the properties window on the right side, when highlighting the imported object/file.
